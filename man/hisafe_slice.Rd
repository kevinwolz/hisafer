\arguments{
\item{hop}{An object of class hop.}

\item{date}{A character string of the date to plot, in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" or of class Date.}

\item{simu.names}{A character vector of the SimulationNames within \code{hop} to include. Use "all" to include all available values.}

\item{tree.ids}{A numeric vector indicating a subset of tree ids to plot. Use "all" to include all available values.}

\item{plot.x}{Either "x" or "y", indicating which axis of the Hi-sAFe scene should be plotted along the x-axis of the plot.}

\item{Y}{A numeric vector indicating a subset of cell locations to include when summarizing cell/voxel data.
If \code{plot.x} is "x", then this refers to the y coordinates of cells. If \code{plot.x} is "y", then this refers to the x coordinates of cells.}

\item{scene.shift}{A number indicating the number of cells to shift the scene -x (if plot.x = "x") or -y (if plot.x = "y") direction.
Cell rows less than this value will be "flipped" to adjoin the right side of the plot.}

\item{rel.dates}{A character vector (in the format "YYYY-MM-DD") or a vector of class Date of the dates from which to scale all aesthetics set by \code{vars}.
In the plot, all aesthetics set by \code{vars} will be scaled to be between the minimum and maximum values across these dates.}

\item{height.dates}{A character vector (in the format "YYYY-MM-DD") or a vector of class Date of the dates from which the plot height should be determined
from the maximum height of trees and crops in this range.}

\item{max.soil.depth}{The maximum depth for which to plot voxel data. To reduce confusion, this value can be supplied as positive or negative.}

\item{vars}{A list of variable names specifying which simulated variables in \code{hop} should be represented by various plot components.
Plot components include:
\itemize{
 \item{"crown.alpha"}{ - transparency of the tree crown}
 \item{"trunk.alpha"}{ - transparency of the tree trunk}
 \item{"crop.alpha"}{ - transparency of the crop}
 \item{"yield.alpha"}{ - transparency of the yield portion of the crop}
 \item{"voxel.alpha"}{ - transparency of the voxel}
 \item{"voxel.border"}{ - thickness of the voxel border}
 \item{"voxel.L.size"}{ - size of the left circle within the voxel}
 \item{"voxel.C.size"}{ - size of the center circle within the voxel}
 \item{"voxel.R.size"}{ - size of the right circle within the voxel}
 \item{"voxel.L.alpha"}{ - transparency of the left circle within the voxel}
 \item{"voxel.C.alpha"}{ - transparency of the center circle within the voxel}
 \item{"voxel.R.alpha"}{ - transparency of the right circle within the voxel}
}}

\item{tree.rel.vars}{A character string indicating how to group data to determine the maximum value by which to scale tree aesthetics set by \code{vars}.
This can include any combination of "s" for simulation, "y" for year, and "t" for tree.
For example, "sy" would scale all aesthetics set by \code{vars} to the maximum value of each variable in each simulation-year combination.
Passing an empyt string ("") means that all tree aesthetics set by \code{vars} will be scaled to maximum value across all simulations, years, and trees.
Values can include upper case and/or lower case letters.}

\item{crop.rel.vars}{Same as \code{tree.rel.vars} but for crop aesthetics set by \code{vars}. Doesn't include "t".}

\item{voxel.rel.vars}{Same as \code{tree.rel.vars} but for voxel aesthetics set by \code{vars}. Doesn't include "t".}

\item{trees}{A logical indicating whether or not to plot the trees in the scene.}

\item{crops}{A logical indicating whether or not to plot the crops in the scene.}

\item{voxels}{A logical indicating whether or not to plot the voxels in the scene.}

\item{climate}{A logical indicating whether or not to plot climate aspects (precipitation, water table) in the scene.}

\item{mem.max}{An integer specifying the maximum number of days into the past to search
for crop/voxel data when no data is available for \code{date} within \code{hop}.}

\item{plot.rows}{An integer specifying \code{nrow} passed to \code{ggplot2::facet_wrap}.}
