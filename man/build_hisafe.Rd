\usage{
build_hisafe(
  hip,
  files = "all",
  plot.scene = TRUE,
  summary.files = TRUE,
  stics.diagnostics = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{hip}{An object of class "hip". To create a hip object see \code{\link{define_hisafe}}.}

\item{files}{A character string of file types indicating which simulation files to build. Use "all" to write all required simulation files.
Otherwise, select one or more of "sim", "pld", "wth", "tree", "plt", "tec", "par", and "pro".}

\item{plot.scene}{Logical indicating whether \code{\link{plot_hisafe_scene}} should be used to export plots of each scene during the build.}

\item{summary.files}{Logical indicating whether or not to write out summary .CSV files about the experiment and each simulation during the build.}

\item{stics.diagnostics}{Logical indicating whether or not STICS diagnostics files should be exported in the simulation.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list containing the original hip object.
}
\description{
Builds a Hi-sAFe simulation or experiment (a group of simulations) - creates the folder structure and input files.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# For a single Hi-sAFe simulation
mysim <- define_hisafe(path = "./simulations", latitude = 30)

# Building the simulation folder structure & files:
build_hisafe(mysim)

# Once a group Hi-sAFe simulations (experiment) is defined:
myexp <- define_hisafe(path = "./simulations", latitude = c(30,60))

# Building the experiment folder structure & files:
build_hisafe(myexp)
