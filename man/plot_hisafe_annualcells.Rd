\title{Tile plot of Hi-sAFe annualCells output variable}
\usage{
plot_hisafe_annualcells(
  hop,
  variable = "yieldMax",
  simu.names = "all",
  years,
  plot.x = "x",
  trees = TRUE,
  canopies = TRUE,
  plot = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{hop}{An object of class hop.}

\item{variable}{A character string of the name of the variable to color the tiles.}

\item{simu.names}{A character string containing the SimulationNames to include. Use "all" to include all available values.}

\item{years}{A numeric vector of the years within \code{hop} to include. Use "all" to include all available values.}

\item{plot.x}{Either "x" or "y", indicating which axis of the simulation scene should be plotted on the x-axis of the plot.}

\item{trees}{Logical indicating if a point should be plotted at the location of each tree.}

\item{canopies}{Logical indicating if an elipsoid should be plotted representing the size of each tree canopy.}

\item{plot}{If \code{TRUE}, the default, a ggplot object is returned. If \code{FALSE}, the data that would create the plot is returned.}
}
\value{
Returns a ggplot object.
}
\description{
Plots a tile plot of a single Hi-sAFe annualCells output variable.
}
\details{
This function is very picky! You can only facet by two of the three manipulable variables: SimulationName, Year, Month.
You must ensure that the one varibale not used for faceting is fixed at a single value.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# After reading in Hi-sAFe simulation data via:
mydata <- read_hisafe(path = "./")

# You can create a tile plot of monthDirectParIncident:
tile.plot <- plot_hisafe_annualcells(mydata, "yieldMax")

# Once you have the plot object, you can display it and save it:
tile.plot
ggsave_fitmax("yield.png", tile.plot)
}
